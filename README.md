 Pre-Interview Coding Challenge

 Files are being red from the resources folder and the results are created also in the resources folder under results sub-folder.
 The app exposes a controller with 2 andpoints (2 APIs/Functions)
 To run the app you must make a call(http get) to the second function like this:
 http://localhost:8080/2ndAPI/Function/2
 Last part of the path represents the input parameter that is also validated, that means only numbers 1 and 2 is accepted as stated in the requirement.
 The files that are generated as result will have a timestamp appended to their names and the same folder structure as in the input will be used.
